# E-Wallet-App (Payment Wallet Application)

A payment wallet application is a digital platform that allows users to store, manage, and transact money electronically. It serves as a virtual wallet, providing a secure and convenient way for users to make payments, transfer funds, and perform various financial transactions using their mobile devices or computers.
I have developed a Backend application to perform CRUD operations and made Restful APIs Service using JAVA, SpringBoot, Lambok, and Swagger-UI for E-Wallet App. This project allows users to sign up, log in, and Make Payments And transactions.
